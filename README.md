# RUM Archive

The **RUM Archive** is a free, publicly available, and [queryable](https://rumarchive.com/docs/querying) dataset of anonymized Real User Monitoring (RUM) page loads
and third-party resource fetches.

Taking inspiration from projects like the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org) and the [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org),
we aim to make RUM data freely available for researchers to analyze trends in market share and performance analytics.

Want to query this data?  Check out the [documentation](https://rumarchive.com/docs) for details on how to access it.
