## Introduction

RUM Archive datasets are stored in [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery).

To execute queries against RUM Archive datasets, you will need a Google account.

**Note**: BigQuery has costs for storage and querying.  You'll want to review what's available in the [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#free-tier), and estimate how much querying the RUM Archive may cost.  You can read our [tips](/docs/tips#limiting-bigquery-costs) on how to reduce your BigQuery costs.

## Datasets

Each provider of RUM Archive data will store their datasets in a different location.

Review the [datasets](/datasets) documentation for information on where each dataset is located within BigQuery.

The rest of this guide will assume you're querying against the [Akamai mPulse RUM dataset](/datasets/#akamai-mpulse-rum).

## Accessing BigQuery

The first step in querying RUM Archive data is gaining access to Google BigQuery and the desired datasets.

Follow the steps below to link (or create) a BigQuery project to the desired RUM Archive datasets.

1. Log into the [Google Cloud Projects](https://console.cloud.google.com/start) starting page:  
  ![Logging into Google Cloud](/assets/querying-step-1.jpg)
2. Create a new, or use an existing Project:  
  ![Creating a new Google Cloud Project](/assets/querying-step-2.jpg)
3. You can name a new Google Cloud Project whatever you wish:  
  ![Creating a new Google Cloud Project](/assets/querying-step-3.jpg)
4. Head over to the [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) for your new project:  
  ![Google BigQuery Console](/assets/querying-step-4.jpg)
5. We're going to add the desired [datasets](/datasets) to your BigQuery console.  Click on _+ Add Data_ and select _Star a project by name_:  
  ![Adding Data](/assets/querying-step-5.jpg)
6. The shared BigQuery project name should be listed in the [dataset](/datasets) definitions.  In this case, we'll add the [Akamai mPulse RUM dataset](/datasets/#akamai-mpulse-rum) which is under the `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive` project:  
  ![Starring the BigQuery project](/assets/querying-step-6.jpg)
7. You should now see the desired dataset starred in your BigQuery Console:  
  ![BigQuery project starred](/assets/querying-step-7.jpg)

You're all set, and ready to query RUM Archive data.

## Aggregation

All of the data represented in RUM Archive BigQuery tables is **aggregated**.  This means that each row represents _more than one_ datapoint.  In fact, some rows can represent hundreds, thousands or millions of datapoints.

To understand how the aggregated rows are generated, please review the [methodology guide](/docs/methodology/#aggregation).

When querying RUM Archive data, you will be executing standard BigQuery SQL queries against these pre-aggregated rows of data.  From those rows, you should be able to execute any of the [calculations](#calculations) listed below.

### High-Level Example

To illustrate how RUM Archive data is stored with a simple example, please consider 4 unique page loads, using two dimensions (User Agent Family, Country) that track a single Timer (Page Load Time):

<div class="table-container">

| Page Load # | User Agent Family | Country | Page Load Time (ms) |
|:------------|:------------------|:--------|--------------------:|
| 1           | Chrome            | US      |                 100 |
| 2           | Chrome            | DE      |                 200 |
| 3           | Safari            | US      |                 300 |
| 4           | Safari            | US      |                 350 |

</div>

Stored in RUM Archive format, there are 3 unique tuples of dimensions, so there would be 3 rows of aggregated data:

<div class="table-container">

| User Agent Family | Country | PLTCount | PLTHistogram    | PLTAvg | PLTSumLn |
|:------------------|:--------|:---------|:----------------|-------:|---------:|
| Chrome            | US      | 1        | `{"1":[100,1]}` |    100 |    4.605 |
| Chrome            | DE      | 1        | `{"2":[200,1]}` |    200 |    5.298 |
| Safari            | US      | 2        | `{"3":[325,2]}` |    325 |   11.561 |

</div>

With data in this format, one can [calculate](#calculations) many statistics such as any (approximate) percentile, averages, and geometric means.

More information:

* [Histogram format](/docs/methodology/#histogram-format)
* [Histogram bucketing](/docs/methodology/#histogram-bucketing)

## Querying

Each row will contain **dimensions**, **counts** and **timers/metrics**.

* **Dimensions** are used to **aggregate**, **filter** and **group by** data.
* **Counts** are used to understand relative weights of each dimension, and used in most of the statistical calculations
* Each **Timer and Metric** has several columns associated with it to aid in the statistical calculations below

For details on how each RUM Archive table is structured, please see the [tables](/docs/tables) documentation.

**Note**: Most RUM Archive queries should be limited to a single `DATE` (or range) as the RUM Archive tables are partitioned by it.  If you exclude a `DATE` clause, you will be scanning an entire dataset, which can be costly.

### Aggregating

Since RUM Archive data is pre-aggregated, you can apply standard SQL commands to the `BEACONS` (overall matches) and `xyzCOUNT` columns to understand relative totals of the data.

```sql
SELECT  COUNT(*) as ROWCOUNT,
        SUM(BEACONS) as BEACONCOUNT
FROM    `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.rumarchive_page_loads`
WHERE   DATE = "2022-09-01"
```

```json
[{
  "rowCount": "1535341",
  "beaconCount": "268409228"
}]
```

So with the [Akamai mPulse RUM dataset](/datasets/#akamai-mpulse-rum) on `2022-09-01`, there are 1.5 million aggregation rows that represent 268 million page loads (from the **sampled** and **aggregated** dataset).

### Grouping

RUM Archive data can utilize standard `GROUP BY` SQL clauses to group data.

For example, to look at the distinct HTTP Protocol (`PROTOCOL`) dimensions for one day:

```sql
SELECT  PROTOCOL
FROM    `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.rumarchive_page_loads`
WHERE   DATE = "2022-09-01"
GROUP BY PROTOCOL
```

![Query Grouping](/assets/querying-grouping-1.jpg)

### Filtering

RUM Archive data can utilize standard `WHERE` SQL clauses to filter dimensions.

For example, to filter to just `COUNTRY = 'US'`:

```sql
SELECT  PROTOCOL,
        SUM(BEACONS) as COUNT
FROM    `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.rumarchive_page_loads`
WHERE   DATE = "2022-09-01"
    AND COUNTRY = 'US'
GROUP BY PROTOCOL
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
```

![Query Filtering](/assets/querying-filtering-1.jpg)

## Calculations

From these rows and columns, you should be able to calculate:

* Relative weights (popularity) of dimensions within the dataset
* Statistics about each timer and metric:
  * Approximate histograms
  * Approximate percentiles (for all percentiles 0 through 100)
  * Weighted averages
  * Geometric means

### Relative Weights

An important aspect of RUM Archive data is that many [datasets](/datasets) will provide **sampled** data.

As a result, the `BEACONS` and `xyzCOUNT` columns do not represent 100% of the data that happened in the real world.  One should not look at a `BEACONS` count of 100 and assume there were exactly 100 experiences that match the dimensions on that `DATE`.

What can be understood from the `BEACONS` and `xyzCOUNT` columns is relative weighting -- that is, for a single `DATE`, if you look at all matching values for a Dimension and **compare them** to other matching values, you can understand the relative weighting for that day of the dimension.

```sql
SELECT  PROTOCOL,
        SUM(BEACONS) as COUNT
FROM    `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.rumarchive_page_loads`
WHERE   DATE = "2022-09-01"
GROUP BY PROTOCOL
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
```

![Relative Weights](/assets/querying-relative-weights-1.jpg)

### Combined Histograms

For each row, each timer and metric in the RUM Archive contains a histogram of values based on [fixed-sized buckets](/docs/methodology#histogram-bucketing).

You can combine multiple row's histograms to calculate a histogram (frequency distribution) for aggregated rows.

The `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive` project provides a public BigQuery function `COMBINE_HISTOGRAMS()` that can combine multiple row's histograms into a combined histogram:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.COMBINE_HISTOGRAMS`(
    histograms ARRAY<STRING>
)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE js
AS ...
```

The `COMBINE_HISTOGRAMS()` function takes a single argument:

* `histograms ARRAY<STRING>`:  You can utilize the BigQuery `ARRAY_AGG()` function to pass in the timer or metric `xyzHistogram` column of choice

Example:

```sql
SELECT  COUNTRY,
        COUNT(*) AS ROWCOUNT,
        SUM(BEACONS) AS BEACONCOUNT,
        `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.COMBINE_HISTOGRAMS`(ARRAY_AGG(PLTHISTOGRAM)) AS PLTHISTOGRAM
FROM    `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.rumarchive_page_loads`
WHERE   DATE = "2022-09-01"
GROUP BY COUNTRY
ORDER BY SUM(BEACONS) DESC
```

![Combined Histograms](/assets/querying-combined-histograms-1.jpg)

Note the use of the BigQuery `ARRAY_AGG()` to pass the `PLTHISTOGRAM` column to the `COMBINE_HISTOGRAMS()` function.

### Approximate Percentiles

By [Combining Histograms](#combined-histograms) of multiple rows, approximate percentiles can be calculated for the matched data.

The `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive` project provides a public BigQuery function `PERCENTILE_APPROX()` that can calculate the approximate percentile for any matching rows.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.PERCENTILE_APPROX`(
    histograms ARRAY<STRING>,
    percentiles ARRAY<FLOAT64>,
    highPrecisionBucketWidth INTEGER,
    includeZero BOOL)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE js
AS ...
```

The `PERCENTILE_APPROX()` function takes several arguments:

* `histograms ARRAY<STRING>`:  You can utilize the BigQuery `ARRAY_AGG()` function to pass in the timer or metric `xyzHistogram` column of choice
* `percentiles ARRAY<FLOAT64>`: An array of percentiles you'd like calculated
  * A single value in the array (e.g. `[0.5]`) will return an `INTEGER` result
  * Multiple values in the array (e.g. `[0.25, 0.5, 0.75]`) will return a JSON map of input percentiles to their calculations
* `highPrecisionBucketWidth INTEGER`: The width of the timer or metric's [High Precision bucket](/docs/methodology/#page-loads-histogram-buckets), i.e. `100` for Page Load Time
* `includeZero BOOL`: Whether or not to include `0` values in the percentile calculation

Example:

```sql
SELECT  COUNTRY,
        COUNT(*) AS ROWCOUNT,
        SUM(BEACONS) AS BEACONCOUNT,
        `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.PERCENTILE_APPROX`(
          ARRAY_AGG(PLTHISTOGRAM),
          [0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.90, 0.95, 1.0],
          100,
          false) as PERCENTILES,
        `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.PERCENTILE_APPROX`(
          ARRAY_AGG(PLTHISTOGRAM),
          [0.50],
          100,
          false) as MEDIAN
FROM    `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.rumarchive_page_loads`
WHERE   DATE = "2022-09-01"
GROUP BY COUNTRY
ORDER BY SUM(BEACONS) DESC
```

![Approximate Percentiles](/assets/querying-approximate-percentiles-1.jpg)

`includeZero` determines whether or not to include `0` values in the percentile calculation.  If set to `false`, percentile calculations will start at values greater than `0`.

For some timers or metrics, it may make sense ot include zeros, such as Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), where a value of `0` is valid and considered "good".

For example, setting `includeZero` for metrics like CLS will affect the results:

```sql
SELECT  COUNTRY,
        COUNT(*) AS ROWCOUNT,
        SUM(BEACONS) AS BEACONCOUNT,
        PARSE_NUMERIC(`akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.PERCENTILE_APPROX`(
          ARRAY_AGG(CLSHISTOGRAM),
          [0.50],
          10,
          false)) / 1000 as MEDIAN_WITHOUT_ZEROS, -- includeZero: false
        PARSE_NUMERIC(`akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.PERCENTILE_APPROX`(
          ARRAY_AGG(CLSHISTOGRAM),
          [0.50],
          10,
          true)) / 1000 as MEDIAN_WITH_ZEROS -- includeZero: true
FROM    `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.rumarchive_page_loads`
WHERE   DATE = "2022-09-01"
    AND CLSCOUNT > 0
GROUP BY COUNTRY
ORDER BY SUM(BEACONS) DESC
```

A few differences from the last query:

* `includeZero` is set to `true` for one of the columns, `false` for the other
* CLS has a [High Width](docs/methodology/#page-loads-histogram-buckets) of `10`
* CLS should be divided by `1000`, and utilizes `PARSE_NUMERIC()` to do so
* The `CLSCOUNT` clause ensures the query only looks at rows that had a CLS calculation

### Weighted Averages

Each timer and metric contains two columns that can be used to calculate a [weighted average (weighted arithmetic mean)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean).

**Note**: We generally don't recommend using averages when looking at performance metrics, as the distributions tend to be normal (or log-normal), and outliers can affect the data.  Use [approximate percentiles](#approximate-percentiles) instead.  For a longer explanation, [SpeedCurve](https://speedcurve.com) has a [great article on Averages, medians & percentiles](https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/average-median-percentiles).

* A `xyzCOUNT` column
* A `xyzAVG` column

Example calculating the weighted average of Page Load Time by Country (and comparing it to the Median, so you can see how they differ):

```sql
SELECT  COUNTRY,
        COUNT(*) AS ROWCOUNT,
        SUM(BEACONS) AS BEACONCOUNT,
        ROUND(SUM(PLTAVG * PLTCOUNT) / SUM(PLTCOUNT)) AS PLTAVG,
        `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.PERCENTILE_APPROX`(
          ARRAY_AGG(PLTHISTOGRAM),
          [0.50],
          100,
          false) as PLTMEDIAN
FROM    `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.rumarchive_page_loads`
WHERE   DATE = "2022-09-01"
GROUP BY COUNTRY
ORDER BY SUM(BEACONS) DESC
```

![Weighted Averages](/assets/querying-weighted-averages-1.jpg)

### Weighted Geometric Means

Each timer and metric contains two columns that can be used to calculate a [weighted geometric mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_geometric_mean).

* A `xyzCOUNT` column
* A `xyzSUMLN` column

Example calculating the weighted geometric mean of Page Load Time by Country (and comparing it to the weighted geometric mean, and Median, so you can see how they differ):

```sql
SELECT  COUNTRY,
        COUNT(*) AS ROWCOUNT,
        SUM(BEACONS) AS BEACONCOUNT,
        ROUND(SUM(PLTAVG * PLTCOUNT) / SUM(PLTCOUNT)) AS PLTAVG,
        ROUND(EXP(SUM(PLTSUMLN) / SUM(PLTCOUNT))) AS PLTGEOMEAN,
        `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.PERCENTILE_APPROX`(
          ARRAY_AGG(PLTHISTOGRAM),
          [0.50],
          100,
          false) as PLTMEDIAN
FROM    `akamai-mpulse-rumarchive.rumarchive.rumarchive_page_loads`
WHERE   DATE = "2022-09-01"
GROUP BY COUNTRY
ORDER BY SUM(BEACONS) DESC
```
